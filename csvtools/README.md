## Evaluation Framework Result Processing
This toolbox converts the ``csv-files`` of the evaluation framework to LaTeX sources which can be used in documentation.

For Python, it requires ``numpy`` and ``scipy`` for the generation and calcuation of the results; to use the generated
data in LaTeX there must be at least ``pgfplots`` installed.

For more information please consult the pandoc files.
